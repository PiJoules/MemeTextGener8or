when you're the cashier
when you're watching a movie
when a black guy
i need to shit
when a co-worker says that you look ill
meet up with a friend, and he's hanging out with someone I never met
when the high five
friend going to a grandfather's funeral
at a sleepover in a friend's house
you laugh when your friend says something
