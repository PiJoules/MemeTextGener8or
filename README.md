# Randomly Generate Text on a given meme
Sample text

## Current Idea
1. Generate random top and bottom text using pieces of text through markov chains.
2. Place this random text on an advice animal or whatever.
```sh
$ python main.py sampletexts/Huck.txt
"Buck went off with the quality,

or at a thing.
$ python main.py sampletexts/Huck.txt
You've been treated bad, and you

made up our sheets and make allowances.
$ python main.py sampletexts/Huck.txt
They peddle out such a life,

and I come away, anyhow."
```

## Older Ideas
1. Get the actual text associated with a meme from reddit bots like /u/imgurtranscriber or /u/captionbot.
2. Using this meme and text, generate a word map for that specific meme using markov chains.
3. Detect the meme using some sort of image comparison algorithm.
